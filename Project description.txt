Thanos Dataiku project

##########################################################################################################################################################################
The purpose of this project is to create a recommendation tool based on the project from the link:https://blog.dataiku.com/outfit-recommendation-system
where the author implements an recommendation model based on the polyvore dataset: https://github.com/xthan/polyvore-dataset

In summary the authr get cloth images from the polyvore that can form a proper outfit. Then imports the data using cv2 library and vectorize it.
Autoencoders are used to get the embeddings from the images. Autoencoders are used for each different category of the cloths in order to capture the 
essence of the images learn a compressed representation of them that captures their most important features.

After that a prediction model is used to predict the number of likes that comes with every outfit in the dataset. Every image from different category 
is encoded from the corresponding encoder and the output is delivered to a fully connected layer. Then the outputs from all the layers are merged and deliverd to a 
fully connected ANN with the output being the predicted number of likes.  

The next step is making recommendations. After we input the clothes we want to get filled with recommendations we get all the combinations of the cloths in 
the wardrobe and a number of likes is given. The outfits with the best scores are being kept. 

In order to take more diverse outfits we try to cluster the results. We form 3 cluster (or the number of recommended outfits we want to have) and take the best choice 
for each cluster.

First we try to describe and define the schema of the outfits. In our project we have one pieces too 
The outfits are:

# Form 1:
#     -Tops
#     -Bottoms
#     -Shoes
#     -Bags
#     -Accessories
#     -Outerwear
    
# Form 2:
#     -Onepiece
#     -Shoes
#     -Bags
#     -Accessories
#     -Outerwear

STEP 1:
In the first step we try to extract the outfits with the above schema. In order to do it we have to preprocess the polyvore csv file.
We follow authors stragety and seperate womens clothes from mens and kids maybe. We can achieve that using NLP on the description feature.
